# Assignment 1: Linear Regression Project

## Overview

This project implements a simple linear regression model from scratch to predict the profit of a restaurant based on the population size of a city. It includes Python functions to load data, compute the cost function, and compute gradients for the model parameters using gradient descent.

### Features

- Load dataset from text files.
- Compute the cost function for linear regression.
- Compute the gradient for parameters `w` (weight) and `b` (bias).
- Implement gradient descent to minimize the cost function.
