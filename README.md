# Assignment 1: Linear Regression Project

## Overview

This project implements a simple linear regression model from scratch to predict the profit of a restaurant based on the population size of a city. It includes Python functions to load data, compute the cost function, and compute gradients for the model parameters using gradient descent.

### Features

- Load dataset from text files.
- Compute the cost function for linear regression.
- Compute the gradient for parameters `w` (weight) and `b` (bias).
- Implement gradient descent to minimize the cost function.


# Assignment 2: Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition, Multiclass


## Overview

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project that uses neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (0-9). The project is structured as an interactive practice lab, where users can understand and implement the key concepts of neural networks, including the ReLU activation function, the softmax function, and multiclass classification.

### Features
- Neural Network Implementation: Step-by-step guide to implementing a neural network using TensorFlow, a powerful and widely-used machine learning library.
- ReLU Activation: In-depth explanation and application of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which introduces non-linearity to the model.
- Softmax Function: Utilization of the softmax function for the output layer to interpret neural network outputs as probabilities.
- Multiclass Classification: Detailed approach to handling multiple classes in neural network outputs, allowing for the recognition of different handwritten digits.
- Interactive Exercises: The lab includes hands-on exercises that reinforce learning and understanding of neural network concepts.
